# What's new in `v2.0.0?`

Our family of users and contributors has grown [(a lot!)](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-rest-js/blob/master/docs/FAQ.md#who-is-using-these-packages) since our first release so we decided to rollup our sleeves (groan) and overhaul the API. Our goals were to:

1. Make ArcGIS REST JS as consistent (and simple) as possible
2. Introduce building blocks for compositional/fluent APIs
3. Provide a few new options to reuse common parameters

## Fluent APIs

In [`v2.0.0`](https://github.com/Esri/arcgis-rest-js/releases/v2.0.0) we introduced a new class called [`SearchQueryBuilder`](../../api/portal/SearchQueryBuilder/) to help compose complex parameters.

```ts
import { searchItems, SearchQueryBuilder } from "@esri/arcgis-rest-portal";

const q = new SearchQueryBuilder()
  .match("Trees")
  .and()
  .match("US Forest Service")
  .in("owner")
  .and()
  .startGroup()
   .match("Web Mapping Application")
   .in("type")
   .or()
   .match("Mobile Application")
   .in("type")
 .endGroup()

// "Trees AND owner: US Forest Service AND (type: "Web Mapping Application" OR type: "Mobile Application")"
searchItems({ q })
```

Currently only [`searchItems()`](../../api/portal/searchItems/) and [`searchGroups()`](../../api/portal/searchGroups/) accept `SearchQueryBuilder` as an input, but we've included building blocks (groan) to create additional implementations as well.

## Paging

The promises returned by [`searchItems()`](../../api/portal/searchItems/) and [`searchGroups()`](../../api/portal/searchGroups/) also got a handy new [`nextPage()`](../../api/portal/searchItems/#nextPage) method to make it easier to sift through paginated results.

```ts
searchItems({ q })
  .then(response => {
    if (response.nextPage) {
      r.nextPage()
        .then(responsePageTwo)
    }
  })
```

## Reuse parameters

We added two new methods to `@esri/arcgis-rest-request` as helpers for passing repeat options through.

### [`setDefaultRequestOptions()`](../../api/request/setDefaultRequestOptions/)

Now, if you want to ensure that _all_ requests include a custom option, you can use `setDefaultRequestOptions()`.

```ts
import { request, setDefaultRequestOptions } from "@esri/arcgis-rest-request";

setDefaultRequestOptions({
  headers: { "Custom-Header": "Test Value" }
});

const url = `https://www.arcgis.com/sharing/rest/info`;

// the custom header will *always* be passed along
request(url)
```

You should _not_ pass `authentication` to this method if your code runs in a shared environment like a web server that handles requests for more than one user.

### [`withOptions()`](../../api/request/withOptions/)

If you'd like to selectively append common options to _a specific method_, you can use the new `withOptions()` method.

```ts
import { request, withOptions } from "@esri/arcgis-rest-request";

const authenticatedRequest = withOptions({
  authentication: session
}, request);

// includes authenticated session
authenticatedRequest(url)

// does NOT include authenticated session
request(url)
```

## Breaking Changes

In order to make the API more consistent and a little easier to navigate, we had to break a few üç≥s.

#### One `portal` package to rule them all (even for ArcGIS Online)

We consolidated four existing packages into a new one called [`@esri/arcgis-rest-portal`](../../api/portal/). Whether you want to talk to ArcGIS Online _or_ Enterprise, now you'll do this:
```bash
# new
npm install @esri/arcgis-rest-portal
```
instead of this:
```bash
# old
npm install @esri/arcgis-rest-items &&
@esri/arcgis-rest-users &&
@esri/arcgis-rest-groups &&
@esri/arcgis-rest-sharing
```
The table below lists methods in this package that have been deprecated, given a facelift, or given a new home.

| Old | New | Package
| -- | -- | -- |
| ~~`serializeGroup()`~~ |  | ~~`groups`~~ |
| ~~`addItemJsonData()`~~ | [`addItemData()`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/portal/addItemData/) | ~~`items`~~ |
| ~~`createItemInFolder({ folder })`~~ | [`createItemInFolder({ folderId })`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/portal/createItemInFolder/) | ~~`items`~~ `portal` |
| ~~`searchItems( string|opts )`~~ | [`searchItems( string|opts|Builder )`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/portal/searchItems/) | ~~`items`~~ `portal` |
| ~~`searchGroups( form, opts )`~~ | [`searchGroups( string|opts|Builder )`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/portal/searchGroups/) | ~~`groups`~~ `portal` |
| ~~`getItemResources( opts )`~~ | [`getItemResources( id, opts? )`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/portal/getItemResources/) | ~~`items`~~ `portal` |
| `getUserUrl()` | [`getUserUrl()`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/portal/getUserUrl/) | ~~`auth`~~ `portal` |
| `getPortalUrl()` | [`getPortalUrl()`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/portal/getPortalUrl/) | ~~`request`~~ `portal` |
| `getPortal()` | [`getPortal()`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/portal/getPortal/) | ~~`request`~~ `portal` |
|  | [`SearchQueryBuilder`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/portal/SearchQueryBuilder/) | `portal` |

#### `@esri/arcgis-rest-request`

The only breaking changes we made to `request` were to refactor an internal method and move a couple others into the new [`portal`](../../api/portal/) package.

| Old | New | Package Name |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `getPortalUrl()` | [`getPortalUrl()`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/portal/getPortalUrl/) | ~~`request`~~ `portal` |
| `getPortal()` | [`getPortal()`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/portal/getPortal/) | ~~`request`~~ `portal` |

#### If you work with private services (shhhh)

We didn't make many changes in `@esri/arcgis-rest-auth`, but one method moved and two others got simpler.

| Old | New | Package Name |
| -- | -- | -- |
| `getUserUrl()` | [`getUserUrl()`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/portal/getUserUrl/) | ~~`auth`~~ `portal` |
| `fetchToken(params|opts)` | `fetchToken(opts)` |
| `generateToken(params|opts)` | `generateToken(opts)` |

#### `@esri/arcgis-rest-routing`

In this package, we renamed one constant.

| Old | New |
| -- | -- |
| ~~`worldRoutingService`~~ | [`ARCGIS_ONLINE_ROUTING_URL`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/routing/ARCGIS_ONLINE_ROUTING_URL/) |

#### Geocoding addresses

In the interest of consistency, we renamed the geocoding package too.

```bash
# new
npm install @esri/arcgis-rest-geocoding
```

```bash
# old
npm install @esri/arcgis-rest-geocoder
```

We renamed one method (and one constant) as well.

| Old | New |
| -- | -- |
| ~~`serviceInfo()`~~ | [`getGeocodeService()`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/geocoding/getGeocodeService/) |
| ~~`worldGeocoder`~~ | [`ARCGIS_ONLINE_GEOCODING_URL`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/geocoding/ARCGIS_ONLINE_GEOCODING_URL/) |

#### Querying and editing feature layers

This package was also renamed. If you're already using `queryFeatures()` or making edits inside hosted feature layers, now you'll install this:

```bash
# new
npm install @esri/arcgis-rest-feature-layer
```

instead of this:
```bash
# old
npm install @esri/arcgis-rest-feature-service
```
The `feature-layer` methods that were refactored or re-homed are listed below.

| Old | New | Package |
| -- | -- | -- |
| ~~`addFeatures({ adds })`~~ | [`addFeatures({ features })`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/feature-layer/addFeatures/) |
| ~~`updateFeatures({ updates })`~~ | [`updateFeatures({ features })`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/feature-layer/updateFeatures/) |
| ~~`deleteFeatures({ deletes })`~~ | [`deleteFeatures({ objectIds })`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/feature-layer/deleteFeatures/) |
| ~~`getLayer(url, options)`~~ | [`getLayer(options)`](https://esri.github.io/arcgis-rest-js/api/feature-layer/getLayer/) |

#### Publishing and updating new hosted feature services

If you're already using `rest-js` to publish _new_ hosted feature services, that package has a new (shorter) name too.

```bash
# new
npm install @esri/arcgis-rest-service-admin
```
instead of this:
```bash
# old
npm install @esri/arcgis-rest-feature-service-admin
```
After you save those seven keystrokes, everything else will be familiar.

#### Helper methods

In this release we also made the decision to stop documenting internal helper methods like `appendCustomParams`. In the future, undocumented methods may change without notice.

## Breaking Changes for TypeScript developers

Each package now installs shared TypeScript typings automatically and  re-exports them, so its no longer necessary to install a separate package yourself.

```ts
// old
import { IPoint } from "@esri/arcgis-rest-common-types";
import { reverseGeocode } from "@esri/arcgis-rest-geocoder";

reverseGeocode({ x: 34, y: -118} as IPoint);

// new
import { IPoint, reverseGeocode } from "@esri/arcgis-rest-geocoding";

reverseGeocode({ x: 34, y: -118} as IPoint);
```

If you'd _like_ to install the typings yourself, there is a more concise package name for that too.

```bash
# new package name
npm install @esri/arcgis-rest-types
```

The table below lists interfaces and types that have been removed or renamed in the name of consistency and brevity. This also better aligns the names of options and response interfaces with their corresponding  function.

| Old Interface/Type | New Interface/Type |
| -- | -- |
| ~~`esriFieldTypes`~~ | `FieldTypes` |
| ~~`esriGeometryType`~~ | `GeometryType` |

That's it! We know that moving so much üßÄ is a hassle, but developers of the future send their thanks! üé©
